# An-approach-for-solving-industrial-robot-forward-and-inverse-kinematics

My undergraduate course project from "Robotics and control" class

Introduced a geometric-algebraic method to solve the forward and inverse-pose kinematic transformation based on the six joints industrial robot, Fanuc 2000ib/165EW.
